CreativeCubes is a leading provider of co-working spaces, serviced offices, and flexible office solutions in Melbourne, Australia. With a focus on fostering community, productivity, and collaboration, CreativeCubes offers beautifully designed office spaces in prime locations, catering to businesses of all sizes. Each location features premium amenities, including high-speed internet, wellness studios, meeting rooms, and on-site cafés.

## The Challenge

CreativeCubes faced a critical challenge with the launch of its Richmond office. With empty desks and an urgent need to fill the space, the business required a cost-effective strategy to drive occupancy.

SEO & SEM were managed externally from the US, offering limited strategic advice, while the existing paid search campaign lacked tracking and measurability, making it impossible to assess effectiveness. CreativeCubes needed a tailored approach to drive organic visibility and attract qualified leads.

## Immersing Myself in the Business

To truly understand the needs of the business and align with its goals, I moved into the CreativeCubes Richmond office, immersing myself in the culture and environment. 

This allowed me to work directly with Co-founders Tobi & Gawen, gaining first-hand insights into the brand’s vision and how they interact with clients. By fully absorbing myself into the business, I could better understand how CreativeCubes integrates community and workspace design, helping shape a strategy that resonated with their unique value proposition.

## The Strategy

### Analytics and Conversion Tracking

* Implemented cross-domain conversion tracking to measure leads from all channels accurately.
* Provided clear ROI visibility into both paid and organic performance to guide data-driven decision-making.

### Local SEO Optimisation

* Created location-specific landing pages with optimised local content and structured data markup.
* Enhanced Google My Business listings, ensuring CreativeCubes appeared prominently in local search results.

### Full Google SERP Coverage

* Secured placements via outreach on high-ranking third-party sites ranking for queries such as 'coworking spaces melbourne'.
* Ensured CreativeCubes was visible across paid ads, local map listings and traditional organic snippets.

### Collaborative Paid Search Improvements

* Partnered with paid search consultant, Francesco Greco, to optimise paid search campaigns, reducing costs while increasing lead volume.
* Leveraged paid search data and insights to refine organic strategies for a cohesive multi-channel approach.

### Adapting During COVID-19

* Conducted multiple weekly calls to analyse keyword trends and impression data in a fast-changing environment.
* Adjusted both keyword targeting and product offerings based on emerging search trends, such as a reduction in co-working queries and increased demand for office space.
* Used these insights to optimise floor space allocation in existing locations and plan for future locations to align with shifting market demands.

## The Results

## 100% Occupancy at Richmond & Beyond

Within 12 months, the Richmond office achieved 100% occupancy, successfully filling desks and meeting the urgent goals set by the founder.

#### Scaled Expansion Across Melbourne

The success at Richmond laid the foundation for CreativeCubes to expand into new locations, including Hawthorn, Carlton, Collingwood, and South Melbourne. Today, CreativeCubes operates across 8 locations in Melbourne, cementing its position as a leader in flexible workspaces.

### Dominated Local Search Rankings

CreativeCubes consistently ranked in the top 3 for Google search results across all locations, ensuring visibility through a combination of paid ads, Google My Business listings, and organic search.

### Cost-Effective Lead Generation

By collaborating with Francesco Greco, the paid search campaigns achieved a significant reduction in cost per lead, further supporting occupancy goals efficiently by making better use of available budgets.
