SEEK is a Australia's leading employment marketplace, headquartered in Melbourne. Beyond job listings, SEEK identified an opportunity to deepen its relationship with users by providing career advice and insights to help people make informed decisions about their future.

## The Challenge

SEEK aimed to create a brand-new career advice section to help users understand various roles, explore pathways into those careers, and access salary data and employer insights. The project presented significant challenges:


* SEEK had no existing content, traffic, or market presence in the career advice space.
* Established platforms already held substantial market share, making it difficult for SEEK to break through.
* Creating high-quality content for hundreds of roles was a resource-heavy and time-intensive process, limiting the speed of growth.

SEEK needed a strategy that could rapidly build a competitive product while scaling efficiently and driving tangible results.

## Why I Love This Case Study

### Strategic Data Use

One of the highlights of this project was the way we combined reverse-engineering competitors with SEEK’s own first-party data. By identifying the highest-traffic roles on competitor sites and overlaying that with search volume, job listings, projected job growth and salary insights from SEEK’s database, we could target roles that had both user interest and business value both now and in the future.

### Iterative Development with a Test-and-Learn Approach

Instead of waiting to launch the perfect product, we adopted a good-better-best content strategy:

* Pages were initially launched with minimal data (titles, salaries, and user reviews).
* We monitored the performance of these 'Good' pages and prioritised high-performing roles for further content development.
* This iterative approach not only sped up growth but also ensured resources were focused where demand was evident.

### Collaborative Excellence

The collaboration between SEO, UX, dev and content teams was a standout aspect of this project. The UX team conducted user interviews with employees and candidates to understand what users valued most on role pages. This input ensured the platform was both user-centric and search-optimised, a balance that proved essential to the project’s success.

### User-Generated Content

Incorporating real-life insights from SEEK profile users added authenticity and depth to the content. This not only enriched the platform but also gave it a competitive edge by offering unique, user-driven perspectives on different careers at a scale and frequency that competitors could not match.

### Seeing It Go National

The moment the platform became part of SEEK’s nationwide marketing campaign, 'The SEEKRET' was a proud achievement. The campaign showcased SEEK’s ability to provide detailed career insights, making the platform an integral part of SEEK’s brand message.
