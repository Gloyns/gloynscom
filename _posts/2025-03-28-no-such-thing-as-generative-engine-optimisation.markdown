I’ve had a number of people ask me recently about 'GEO', or 'Generative Engine Optimisation' — how to get their content/brand into tools like GPT, Perplexity, and whatever’s next. 

Whilst I can completely understand where this is coming from, a small part of me dies inside as it just feels like the same misguided mindset that plagued the early days of SEO - chasing algorithms instead of serving people.

<h2>The Engine Is Not Your Audience</h2>

What we’ve learnt over the years is that these systems always evolve. And with every iteration, they get better at aligning with what people actually want rather than what’s been gamed into their results. The gap between trickery and trust gets smaller each time.

Still, the temptation is real. You might get a spike in visibility from some clever tactic or exploit. But if your focus is on manipulating the system instead of creating something genuinely useful, that visibility will fade — fast.

It’s a mistake SEOs have been making for decades: designing for the engine instead of the person.

Whether it was Google in 2011 or GPT-5 in 2025, the mindset has often been the same — find the flaw, fire your shot, and hope it lands. Like Luke Skywalker taking out the Death Star by nailing the exhaust port. That’s what I call DSEO: Death Star Engine Optimisation.

And hey, back then, it worked. I remember one Saturday morning I bought an exact match domain, spun up a templated site with some basic copy, threw a few shady links at it, and by lunchtime, I was ranking #1. It was absurd. But the engines were simple, and the tricks were cheap.

Those days are over. Today’s AI systems are smarter, faster, and learning directly from how people interact with content. Chasing the quirks of these models is just the same hollow game in a shinier wrapper. And the real win — the sustainable win — still comes from the same place it always has: being genuinely useful to real people.

<h2>The Pace of Change Is Only Accelerating</h2>

Outside of some intense periods, we've generally become accustomed to Google algorithm updates every few months. Sometimes the biggeer updates forced us to adapt, but we had time. We could run tests, observe patterns, reverse engineer, reflect and gradually shift strategies.

That luxury is gone.

With AI systems, we’re not dealing with quarterly updates anymore. These models are being retrained, fine-tuned, and reinforced at a rate we’ve never seen before. 

These models adapt based on how people interact with their outputs. If someone skips a response, rephrases their question, or asks for a source, that’s feedback. The model learns. The loop is tighter, the turnaround faster. And that means even if you manage to 'optimise' your way into visibility today, you’ll drop out just as fast if the content doesn’t deliver value to the user.

Trying to stay one step ahead by guessing what the model wants is a race you’ll lose — because what the model wants is what people want. And people don’t reward fluff, misdirection, or content built purely to game a system. They reward usefulness.

<h2>Mid-Funnel Is the New Battleground</h2>

<img src="/images/ai-seo-marketing-funnel.png" loading="lazy">

For years, content strategies have obsessed over top-of-funnel visibility — ranking for broad, high-volume queries to capture attention — and bottom-of-funnel conversion — optimising landing pages to close the deal. 

But AI is collapsing those stages, and it’s the middle — the mid-funnel — where the real battle is happening.

This is where people are comparing, questioning, validating, and getting closer to making decisions. They’re not just asking 'what is X?' or 'where do I buy Y?' — they’re asking which one is better for me, why does this matter, how do I weigh my options, what do others say about this, what should I watch out for? The context layer.

AI systems can do teh top funnel stuff all day long and way better than you can. They're also stepping in to answer those layered, contextual, comparative queries. They’re scanning, synthesising, and presenting condensed insights across multiple sources. If your content doesn’t help someone move forward in this decision-making process — if it’s vague, shallow, or transparently self-serving — it won’t surface. Or worse, it’ll be summarised in a way that strips out your brand entirely.

This shift is a huge opportunity for those willing to invest in useful, trustworthy content. Not clickbait. Not fluff. Not keyword-stuffed filler. But clear, relevant, human-first content that helps people weigh up their choices. That’s the stuff AI models are looking for — because it’s what people actually want.

<h2>So, What to Do Next?</h2>

Ignore the hype. Forget trying to reverse-engineer language models or squeeze your way into GPT through tricks and trends. The fundamentals haven’t changed — they’ve just become more important, more visible, and harder to fake.

Focus on creating content that earns its place — content that answers real questions, guides real decisions, and builds real trust. That means understanding your audience deeply, showing up in the messy middle with clarity and confidence, and being useful in a way no shortcut can replicate.

You don’t need to optimise for the engine. You need to optimise for the person the engine is trying to serve.

That’s the work that lasts. Always has, always will.
