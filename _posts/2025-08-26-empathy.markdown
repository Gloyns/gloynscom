I could probably start and finish this blog in one sentence: you need to actually give a shit about your users.

I spend a lot of time working with people to understand why their content underperforms in search. Often, I’m handed a piece of content and asked, "How would you improve this?"

There’s usually this expectation that I’ll come back with a list of fixes of adding new sections or a table of contents etc and maybe some of that stuff might help at the margins but it won't result in a step change in performance. 

More often than not, the real reason content doesn’t rank or perform is because it doesn't actually satisfy the user.

We use that phrase a lot though - 'User satisfaction'. When you dig into it, it becomes quite clear why content is underperforming: It doesn’t connect, and it doesn’t truly help as it's missing the human element.

<h2>The Missing Half of 'User Intent'</h2>

We talk about user intent in SEO all the time.

The real questions are:

<ol>
<li>What is the person actually trying to achieve?</li>
<li>Where are they at emotionally?</li>
</ol>

That’s the missing part. What’s their emotional state? Because if you can tap into that - if you can empathise, if you can truly understand their situation and then give them content that meets them there, isn’t that the whole point?

We often lose sight of this and default to checklists like topic clusters and heading structures. But none of that matters if the content doesn't care about the person reading it. Their feelings in that moment shape everything: how you start the article, how you speak to them, and how you end it.

Empathy is how you win. Empathy is how you rank and get cited in Google, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude etc

<h2>How This Changes Everything</h2>

Let me give you an example. I worked with SEEK on an article about, ‘What to wear to a job interview’.

<h3>The "Factual" Intent</h3>

This part is clear. They want a list of ideas for what to wear. They’re looking for clear instructions, photo examples, an understanding of formality, and a list of things to avoid.

<h3>The "Emotional" Intent (The Real Value)</h3>

This is where the magic is. Think about the person searching for this. They’ve gone through a huge effort to get to this point.

<ul>
<li>They’ve likely sent out dozens of applications and faced rejection.</li>
<li>Now, they finally have an interview and are naturally anxious.</li>
<li>They have a deep-seated fear of being judged incorrectly and losing this opportunity over something as simple as their outfit.</li>
<li>They’re hopeful, but they’re also lacking confidence and just want to be told what to wear and why.</li>
</ul>

When you understand that, you can't just write a generic tick-box article. Your entire approach changes.

<h3>Here's the bland, old-school SEO version:</h3>

<em>When preparing for that important meeting or job interview, knowing what to wear to an interview can make a measurable difference. Whether you’re aiming for professional interview attire or business casual outfit ideas, the right choice sets a confident tone. From tailored suits to polished separates, your attire can signal competence, credibility, and cultural fit...</em>

It's 'optimised' in a classic sense, but it's also robotic and misses the human connection.

<h3>Here's the empathetic version (that gives a shit):</h3>

<em>Whether it’s your first job, you’re returning to the workforce or you’re changing industries, finding the right interview clothes can be one of the most daunting parts of job seeking. You naturally want to make the best first impression possible, which is why presentation is so important.</em>

<em>Before getting ready for your job interview, read this guide for tips. As you prepare for your interview, remember that no matter what you wear, you should aim to feel comfortable and confident.</em>

See the difference?

You’ve acknowledged their journey, validated their anxiety, and positioned your advice as the key to the confidence they crave. You’ve shown them you get it. You’ve given them a reason to trust you.

<h2>From 'Content' to 'Content as a Product'</h2>

This is where we can shift our thinking. When you focus on the user's entire problem (the factual + the emotional), you stop making content and you start creating a product.

A product-led mindset just means your content isn't an asset designed to attract a click. It is the solution itself. Your article is helpful in solving their problem.

Most strategies today focus on visibility in AI engines (AEO/GEO/Other). But visibility isn't the goal. For it to matter, you must be the solution they're looking for. This is the difference between being a mention and being the answer.

<h2>How to Build an Empathetic, Product-Led Strategy</h2>

So, how do we weave this into our daily work?

1. Add ‘Emotional State’ to Your Briefs Right alongside ‘User intent’, get the team to consider: What is the user feeling right now? Fear? Excitement? Confusion? Overwhelm? This will guide everything.

Example User Intent: The user needs clear guidance on what to wear for an interview to eliminate guesswork.

Example Emotional State: The user is anxious and under pressure. They are looking for expert advice to boost their confidence and provide a sense of control.

2. Let Emotion Guide Your Tone and Structure. The user’s emotional state should directly influence your tone. If they’re anxious, your tone must be reassuring and build confidence. If they’re confused, it needs to be exceptionally clear. How you say it is just as important as what you’re saying.

3. Map the Entire User Journey, Not Just the Query. A user's problem rarely ends with a single search. If a user is overwhelmed by 'what to wear', what’s their next problem? Probably 'common interview questions'. 

Think about their 'Jobs To Be Done' and what emotional barriers they face at each step. Your content should guide them to that next solution.

4. Compete on Utility, Not Just Keywords. In a product-led world, you compete on actual utility. The best answer wins because it solves the problem better. Your content must be the solution.

<h2>This is Forever Future Proof</h2>

The truth is, all platforms (Google, ChatGPT, Perplexity) have the same goal: they need to keep users on their platform. The only way to do that is to give them answers that are not just correct, but genuinely helpful and satisfying. They are all trending toward providing solutions, not just links.

The core principle has been true for decades: solve real user problems, and the systems that connect users to solutions will find you.

The interface changes, the algorithms evolve, but human nature doesn't.

If you keep your focus on the human on the other side of the screen, their 'job to be done', and their emotional state, you'll create something that is genuinely helpful.

I can’t think of an instance when that hasn’t ever been the right direction to go.
