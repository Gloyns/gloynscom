<h1>About me</h1>
Outside of work I’m a Dad to 2 wonderful kids, a dog, cat, 22 chickens, 2 goats and many mob of roos. Spare time is very quickly filled.

<h2>My Background</h2>

From 2010 to 2015, I worked in-agency as a Head of/Director of SEO, leading highly skilled teams across Melbourne and Sydney to deliver exceptional results for blue-chip clients.

During this time, I noticed a shift in how businesses approached SEO. As in-house teams became more digitally mature, the traditional agency model started to feel outdated. SEO was evolving from a service that could be entirely outsourced to a collaborative process. 

Clients no longer needed someone to 'do' SEO for them; they needed strategic direction to guide their efforts.

In 2015, I launched my consultancy to fill this gap, providing tailored strategic support to client teams. My focus was - and still is - on helping businesses understand what to prioritise for SEO and how to align these activities with their quarterly planning to achieve sustainable growth.

I’m proudly independent and work with a select group of clients, valuing high-engagement partnerships that drive results we can both be proud of.

Many of my clients have been with me since the beginning. Nine years on, I’m proud to maintain an average client tenure of 7 years - testament to the trust, results, and relationships we’ve built together.
