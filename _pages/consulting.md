<h1>SEO Consulting</h1>
<p>Engagements typically fall into four different types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Embedded SEO Expert (Monthly Retainer)</li>
  <li>Project-Based SEO Support (Set Fee)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>SEO Strategy</li>
    <li>Site Migration</li>
    <li>Organic Traffic Reduction</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Adhoc Consultancy (Hourly Rate)</li>
  <li>SEO Expert Witness (Hourly Rate)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Embedded SEO Expert</h2>
<p>Many organisations struggle to gain cut through or momentum in organic growth due to low level of internal expertise and/or ineffective support from agencies.</p>
<p>Delivering organic growth requires an understanding of the landscape, the business, people, and product – both now and in future-state. Being deeply integrated and embedded within the organisation facilitates the rapid definition of an SEO roadmap that can be delivered over time within the organisation.</p>
<p>Day-to-day this means I’m either directly onsite sitting within your team (limited availability) or working remotely with teams across marketing, content, UX, and development to create and deliver on the SEO roadmap as well as general ownership of SEO for issues and opportunities as they arise. Also includes creation of SEO dashboards for measurement and reporting on progress.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> SEEK hired me to provide direction and support across various areas of the business, mostly focusing on career & learning products. I work both onsite and remotely with product, marketing, content, UX, and development teams.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> A leading Real Estate Portal worked with me because I deliver real results (and they appreciated my honesty!). I worked on and offsite, directly with their teams, and reported progress and opportunities to leadership.</p>

<h2>Project-Based Support</h2>
<p>A one-off engagement with a set fee/time limit to deliver a defined objective.</p>

<h2>SEO Strategy</h2>
<p>Popular with startups or those just starting out in SEO, looking to understand the SEO landscape and general direction.</p>
<ul>
 <li>SEO Landscape Analysis</li>
 <li>Competitor Analysis & Insights</li>
 <li>SEO Roadmap of Key Priorities to Increase Market Share</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, these result in an ongoing retainer arrangement to support the delivery of the roadmap, but it is entirely optional.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A large classifieds site hired me to provide insight into their current market share vs competitors, including key risks and opportunities to increase market share.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A popular clothing brand hired me to understand what was working for competitors, what was working for them, and what the business needed to stop, start, and keep doing to increase organic visibility.</p>

<h2>Site Migration</h2>
<p>I’ve supported hundreds of site migrations over the years, helping organisations minimise the risk of moving to a new site structure while identifying new opportunities for traffic growth.</p>
<p>I work closely with both internal and external teams (e.g., design/dev agencies) to ensure we minimise traffic loss and maximise growth where possible. My process includes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Baseline & Post-Launch Reporting to Measure Success and Identify Issues</li>
 <li>Pre-Migration Content Auditing/Cross-Check</li>
 <li>SEO Checklist for Best-Practice Optimisation</li>
 <li>On-Page Optimisation</li>
 <li>URL Mapping for Redirects</li>
 <li>Live Support During Migration</li>
 <li>Post-Migration Support to Resolve Issues and Identify Priorities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Nine Digital hired me to provide SEO advice on the merger of drive.com.au & caradvice.com.au following the acquisition of the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> ArtsHub hired me to provide support during the design and build process for a re-platform and migration from a custom CMS to WordPress across two sites and two geo-locals.</p>

<h2>Organic Traffic Reduction</h2>
<p>I work with organisations experiencing either an abrupt or gradual decline in organic traffic to provide answers and proactive steps for:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What happened?</li>
 <li>What did we do?</li>
 <li>How do we fix it?</li>
 <li>How do we avoid it happening again?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A well-known magazine experienced an instant 30% decline in traffic without a clear reason. Extensive forensic analysis revealed site quality issues, leading to recommendations to drastically improve quality signals to algorithms and overall user experience.</p>

<h2>Adhoc SEO Consultancy</h2>
<p>Need sporadic advice? I’m available for 30- or 60-minute consultations to answer any questions you have.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A US-based startup founder consulted me on content creation, platform choices, third-party analysis tools, and debunking SEO myths.</p>

<h2>SEO Expert Witness</h2>
<p>I’m available as an expert witness for SEO/organic search-related matters. I bring deep knowledge of SEO algorithms, Google guidelines, and strategies employed to improve rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A Melbourne law firm hired me to create a report supporting their client’s dispute over brand misuse in an SEO play. My report contributed to resolving the matter before trial.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Another law firm hired me to advise a client on minimising SEO impact during a commercial agreement termination, helping them proceed with confidence.</p>
